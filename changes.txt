This morning I built the HTML and attempted to create the JS- I've uploaded it
to Github, but I decided it needed to be redone. So I redid it with chartData as
one object, instead of four strings. This should also help with task management.
I've also been completely rewriting the script and eliminating old code.
Later-
I worked on some of the things dealing with the people list- all three of the
buttons now work and it should save to chartData, but not localStorage: that
would happen in the Update and Close step.

I changed job to task in everything.
People isn't saving, but I remember working on that. EDIT: this is intentional,
it should not update yet.
I've been working on the people dropdown.
I've started a color palette.

I've started moving from onclick to getelementbyid event
I've been cleaning up my code
I need to fix some css, eg textboxes.
Converting to Material Design...?
  I need to update the script to match my amazing styling.

I was in the middle of setting up templates for selecting names.

the update button should save the names and things.

To-Do
  When put on github the page needs a /fonts directory.
  tasks:
    Create better styling for editable text
    Create popout editor for task repetition
    Create dropdown that accesses people names
    Save tasks to chartData
  Update and Close step: save to localStorage
    should not need createChartData- it will already be done.
  Chart Builder
    still figuring this one out...
